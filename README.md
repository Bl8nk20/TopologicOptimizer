# TopologicOptimizer

This should become an external Library to be included in the FreeCAD Environment.


## Questions to Tackle
Where has to be material to assert the function of the piece?

## Target

Optimize CAD-Models for weight-reduction, optimization for strength and optics for a better fdm printing experience

## Possible Input parameters

### external forces
like torque, gravity, general forces or momentum

### construction limitations
like building-area, mounting-points or allowed material type / material amt
